        <!-- The Genesis Section -->
        <div class="section genesis" id="genesis">
            <h2>The Genesis</h2>
            <p>During my first year of post-secondary education, a neighbor sought a Pre-Calculus 11 math tutor for her daughter. Despite never having tutored math before, I seized the opportunity. The initial sessions were successful, leading to referrals and a growing number of clients. This experience illuminated a significant need in my community.</p>
            <p>Struggling with STEM subjects during high school, I often relied on online resources like YouTube tutorials and Khan Academy. Yet, these methods were not universally effective. Tutoring revealed a vital truth: every student learns differently. Regrettably, the prevalent “one size fits all” educational approach in local high schools left many students floundering. Recognizing an opportunity to make a difference, I founded JUNO Learning, anchored in two beliefs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every student learns differently.</li>
                <li>Any student can master any subject with the right guidance and support.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <!-- The Problem Section -->
        <div class="section problem" id="problem">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>As my tutoring business expanded, managing logistics became increasingly cumbersome. Scheduling sessions, handling reschedules, and maintaining calendar updates through texts became a logistical maze. I aspired to leverage my academic learnings to devise a solution, leading to the development of the JUNO Learning app.</p>
        </div>
    
        <!-- The Design Section -->
        <div class="section design" id="design">
            <h2>The Design</h2>
            <p>Key user stories driving the app design included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scheduling and managing sessions effortlessly.</li>
                <li>Exploring local tutors.</li>
                <li>Streamlining logistical elements (Zoom links, payment, reminders) within the app.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I initiated the design process with wireframes, followed by detailed mockups using Figma. This process honed my skills in Frame organization and Auto Layout, enhancing the design workflow.</p>

        <!-- Figma Mockups Section -->
        <div class="section figma-mockups" id="figma-mockups">
            <h2>Figma Mockups</h2>
            <p>After the wireframes, I began designing the app with Figma. I gained greater confidence and skills in using Figma, specifically in Frame organization and utilizing the Auto Layout function for a smoother design process.</p>

        <!-- Key Features Section -->
        <div class="section key-features" id="key-features">
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <p>“Today” Page: Auto-updated daily, streamlining session management. The intuitive Zoom meeting button simplifies meeting setups, a feature born out of firsthand tutoring experience.</p>
            <p>“Calendar” Page: Provides an organized monthly view of sessions, aiding in effective scheduling.</p>
            <p>“Explore” Page: Allows students to discover tutors in their area, view their ratings, offered courses, and sample teaching videos. This fosters better tutor-student matches.</p>
            <p>“Profile” Page: A hub for logistical information - current course load, payment details, transaction history, and a 'Learner Profile' showcasing achievements.</p>
        </div>
    
        <!-- Next Steps Section -->
        <div class="section next-steps" id="next-steps">
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>I am currently expanding the team to include designers and developers, aiming for a launch in Summer 2024. My immediate focus is on finalizing the app design in Figma and commencing the development of its core functionality in Xcode using Swift, with a focus on Object-Oriented Design.</p>

        <!-- Lessons Learned Section -->
        <div class="section lessons-learned" id="lessons-learned">
            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>JUNO Learning has been a journey of immense growth and learning. It's been gratifying to aid students from diverse backgrounds in achieving their academic and athletic aspirations. Additionally, this venture has taught me invaluable lessons in business development and honed my UI/UX design skills.</p>
